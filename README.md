# Intermittent Failure of Tailwind CSS Responsive Modifiers

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers are intermittently failing to apply styles at larger breakpoints. The issue is not consistent across all classes or elements; some modifiers work as expected, while others do not, even after purging the CSS.

## Bug Description
Tailwind CSS classes with responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:text-xl`, `lg:bg-blue-500`) do not always apply styles at the appropriate breakpoint.  This behavior is inconsistent and seemingly random, affecting only certain classes on specific elements.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
3. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
4. Resize the browser window to trigger the breakpoints. Observe that some responsive styles apply, while others do not.

## Potential Causes
* **Conflicting CSS:**  Overriding styles from other sources (e.g., custom CSS or conflicting framework styles).
* **Incorrect Breakpoint Definition:** Incorrectly configured Tailwind breakpoints.
* **Caching Issues:** Despite purging, cached CSS might be interfering.
* **Order of Classes:** The order of classes might be affecting the application of styles (although less likely).
* **Complex Selectors:**  The responsive modifiers might not work well with very complex selectors. 

## Solution (bugSolution.html)
The solution might involve carefully reviewing conflicting styles, checking Tailwind's breakpoint definitions, and ensuring the CSS order doesn't interfere. In the `bugSolution.html` file, these potential issues are addressed by clearly separating and organizing the Tailwind CSS classes.
