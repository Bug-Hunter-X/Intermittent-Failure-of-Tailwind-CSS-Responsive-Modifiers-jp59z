I'm encountering an issue where Tailwind CSS classes aren't being applied correctly, specifically when using responsive modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, etc.  My CSS is structured correctly according to the Tailwind documentation, and I've purged the CSS, but the styles aren't being picked up at larger breakpoints. For example, `md:text-xl` doesn't change the text size when the screen is larger than the md breakpoint. This only occurs on certain classes or elements, while other responsive modifiers work as expected.
